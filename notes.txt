Followed Kevin Dockx's course on pluralsight

Building a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core 3
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-3-restful-api-building

AddControllers() replaces AddMVc() because it only includes what is needed for an API.
AddMvc() adds a lot more that is needed by a web app but not an API.

In Debug props of the project, 
- choose 'project' as launch value 
- uncheck 'launch browser'
- set port to 51044

F5 or click IISExpress play -> API is launched in terminal
